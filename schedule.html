  <h4>Cimpress Shuttles from Jacksonville International Airport to Amelia Island</h4>
  <p class="hidden-xs">Unless arriving by private jet or space craft, Amelia Island is quite remote and that is a very good thing for our purposes. Unfortunately it does make getting here a little complex, but to make it a little easier we will be providing shuttles from the airport on a schedule interval. Details for the shuttles and other modes of transportation to the venue are <a href="/getting-here.html">available here</a>.</p>

  <p class="hidden-xs">After a long day of travel, land at the beach for an evening welcome reception and social gathering. Meet old friends, make new friends, and enjoy the sand between your toes! We will have various things going on during this event including light appetizers and refreshments.</p>

  <h4>Respoke Karaoke Night at JSConf<br/> 9:00PM - 12:00AM</h4>
  <p class="hidden-xs">Come sing and dance your heart out at the local sports bar to some of the greatest 80s songs as sung by your peers (for better or worse). We have clearance from the Omni to have the time of our lives! *clap* *clap*</p>

Why stop with just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r346rRTFvR4">Earth</a>, it is time to take JS to outer space (well, more outer space than drones).
