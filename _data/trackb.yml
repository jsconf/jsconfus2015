  title: Headless Testing Against Real Web Browsers
  body: >
    Continuous integration ensures software's health with each each codebase change, ideally via automated tests and other quality-assurance processes. Tools like Phantomjs offer a great path towards headless JavaScript testing, but what about those scenarios where the software under test requires an actual GUI web browser? Think NW.js, Flash, and Google Polymer web-component-tester. X Virtual Frame Buffer provides an excellent solution towards lightweight, headless testing against real web browsers. In this talk, I'll offer some background on X Virtual Frame Buffer, and demo how to test a Google Polymer web component on a lightweight Ubuntu VM in continuous integration.

  title: Communicate All the Things... With WebRTC!
  body: >
    In this talk we’ll look take a look at WebRTC, a rather new technology that is giving Javascript developers the tools to add real-time communications features to their applications without the need for plugins or learning a new language. We’ll examine the key components of this standard, look at how peer to peer connections are established, and discuss how you can start adding features like video calling and screen sharing to your applications today using the Respoke Javascript library!

  title: You Won’t Believe This One Weird Way to Rewrite Closures
  body: >
    Closures are undoubtedly the most powerful feature JavaScript inherited from its Lisp forbears. But would JS be so powerful… without them?

    We’ll reimplement closures entirely from scratch without the convenience of native local variables or function parameters. Entirely in JavaScript. Using prototypal inheritance, some clever hat-tips from graphics programming, amnesic function bodies, and this one weird global variable.

  title: Umm... I have to do WHAT to run this code?
  body: >
    Whether you work on open source or are hiring developers to work with you, first impressions matter. The first day on with a project is both exciting and challenging for any developer. From missing documentation, unknown dependencies, complex codebases and install processes, it’s a wonder that most people don’t just quit on the spot.

    However, when a plan is in place and when things are handled correctly, the first day with a codebase can become one of the most motivating days for any developer.
