  title: Modular Application Architectures in Javascript
  body: >
    Web applications do not require an over-arching framework to be organized
    and maintainable. In fact, an application with modules from all over the
    place can in fact be maintainable, understandable, and encouraged. Instead
    of subscribing to one framework that provides developers with an entire
    slew of unused or unneeded functionality, an architecture can be built
    from the ground up using small modules from a variety of different sources.


    This kind of architecture is taking off in the Node community, and is
    starting to make its way in client-side javascript. This talk explores
    the differences between using a formal framework- like Ember, Backbone,
    Express, or Sails- and using a modular approach. Frameworks are not
    entirely out of the picture- there are a few examples of frameworks that
    encourage this kind of architecture by providing minimal structure in
    the right places. This talk will explore those frameworks, and the
    general ideas, benefits, and possible pitfalls of a modular architecture,
    from both the client and server-side perspective.

  title: Play DVDs in JavaScript for the sake of interoperability
  body: >
    We have everything we need to read DVD-video discs in a browser, so why
    don’t we start?


    For that purpose, I ported libdvdread and libdvdnav libraries to
    JavaScript so that we can parse the DVD-video info files and emulate
    a virtual machine.


    But this comes with technical challenges such as browsers being bad
    at manipulating huge files or not supporting the codecs used in DVD
    (MPEG-2, AC-3...). That’s why this port comes with a server in Node.js
    to circumvent these limitations.


    The resulting project is a mix of websockets, video elements, media
    source extensions and a lot of open source love.


    Get ready for a mind blowing demo!

  title: Learning ES6 as a Community
  body: >
    The current schedule for the completion of ECMAScript 6, the next version of
    JavaScript, dictates that the language specification be finished by the end
    of the second quarter of 2014. Most browser vendors have made informal
    commitments to have ES6 implemented by the end of the year. Over the last couple
    years, we've heard a lot about the many new features in ES6, along with the debate
    (and bickering) which has gone into its design. ES6 stands to be the most substantial
    change to JavaScript since ES4 (which didn't work out that great, as most users of
    ES5 are aware).


    With this much change comes a lot of complexity. Many of the new features
    (like generators or proxies) are powerful, basic abstractions, and as such
    combine in complex (and potentially unexpected) ways. In many ways, a new version
    of JavaScript offers the possibility of returning us to the wild frontier days
    that JavaScript only recently left behind, with library and framework vendors each
    choosing their own combinations of features to build powerful (and complicated)
    architectures that can really only be understood on their own terms.


    However, as a community we've learned a lot over the last half decade or so, and
    I think we've learned how to tackle this problem head on. I've come up with a
    strategy that I think would allow us to collaboratively get to a good place with
    ES6 relatively quickly. I'll go over this strategy and point to the areas where
    I think we ought to spend the most time to get the most positive results.


    It's up to us – as a community of designers, developers, and implementors – to
    get out in front and provide tooling, documentation, and training that will
    help ourselves use these new features effectively, before folklore and superstition
    start to take root. And it's important to remember that finishing ES6 frees the
    JavaScript standards bodies to concentrate on ES7, where our feedback from using
    ES6 will help them refine what comes next.

  title: Unshackling JavaScript with Macros
  body: >
    JavaScript is thriving, but the language itself is shackled to the
    long process of ECMA standardization and implementation in all
    engines. We have to wait many years for a simple feature like variable
    destructuring.


    Macros allow you to extend a language with new syntax and semantics,
    just like you would build new APIs on top of native ones. There's no
    reason the language itself shouldn't be extensible, which allows it to
    grow naturally.


    sweet.js is a project that implements robust hygienic macros for
    JavaScript. I will explain how this works and why it's such an
    exciting idea. I will show how you can already have ES6 variable
    destructuring, classes, fat arrow syntax, and more just with a few
    macros. In addition, you can use things like function tracing, native
    pattern matching, better assertions (logs contain the original
    expression), and much more. sweet.js macros track the original source
    location and generates sourcemaps, so debug away like normal! Let's
    unshackle ourselves from the mire of standardization, and take control
    of the language we love!

    We live in a time of vast computational resources - many of us

    We have cycles to spare, by investing some of them into immutable data

    design solutions at a much higher level of abstraction. Om is a new

    Even something as simple as a dropdown menu or a bar graph can introduce usability problems. From a slide out menu disappearing when a user's mouse moves a few pixels too far, to requiring NASA-like levels of precision to mouse over the right element, there are algorithms already implemented in Javascript to help us overcome these problems.
    If an algorithm is defined as "a step-by-step procedure for calculations", let's visually break down those steps for 2 different non-trivial algorithms and explore how these algorithms are applied to some standard & everyday user interface patterns. We'll first look at an algorithm for predicting a user's intentions by calculating mouse speed and direction, and then tackle determining hit state for hundreds of non-uniformed, variably sized and placed UI elements.

    Almost.  Maybe.  Sometimes.  Sort of.  Many disclaimers and restrictions apply.
    But what will it take for the answer to just be "yes"?


    This talk will dive deep into the world of native code on the web, compiling C++ into
    JavaScript, and look at the gaps that need to be filled.  A number of intertwined topics
    will be touched on, including: Emscripten, PNaCl, pepper.js, JS VM and browser internals,

    How does the transition into ES6 modules work for browsers exactly? How do

    loader from the core.


    In short, jspm starts off by making ES6 modules work dynamically in browsers today
    through the dynamic ES6 Module Loader polyfilll, then we make all existing module
    formats work through this same loader, then then we add offline build workflows
    for production and a command-line package manager to allow modular dependency management.
    Finally turn the whole thing around and add a CDN with server-push, and you have
    install-free version-managed module loading in the browser.

    This talk is about a modular frontend which is an approach not common to most frontend developers. No jQuery, no frameworks. Instead many small, simple abstractions are used, published to npm and bundled with browserify.


    The NPM-style frontend prefers modularity and simple abstractions that do one thing well.  THis talk includes:

     * Various approaches to creating standalone "components" or "widgets" that are published to npm, including styles & templates.
     * How to compose various modules together to build your own "framework" with your own trade offs.
     * How to compose an application from smaller applications
     * Build small UI components with thin interfaces that you glue together in your application.


    Your entry point is small, containing the minimal glue code and each UI component addresses its own concerns.

  title: Building Isomorphic Apps
  body: >
    After building more and more rich and complex JavaScript apps at Airbnb,
    we started to see the single-page app approach break down.  The language
    and environment barriers between our Rails server and fat client app caused
    code duplication and the lack of server-side rendering led to slow initial
    page load performance and SEO headaches.


    The dream of a shared UI layer and reusable business logic led us to start
    experimenting with ways to bring these apps back to the server.  We started
    by converting our mobile web site, a Backbone app, to also run on Node.js and
    Express, which led to the open-source Rendr library.  Since then we’ve learned
    a lot and have begun to refine our understanding of "isomorphic JavaScript".


    There are a wide range of approaches which might be considered
    "isomorphic" — an app could share just a few tiny modules of business logic, or
    just templates, or route definitions; or it might try to share the entire application code.
    The more code that is shared, the more abstractions have to be built to shim the differences
    between the very dissimilar environments of web browser and server, and the more
    complex and tightly-coupled the result will be.


    This talk will give some broader context for isomorphic JavaScript, show some real world
    examples, explain common application patterns for isomorphic apps, and then dive into the
    open-source tools and libraries that you can use to build isomorphic apps: libraries like
    Handlebars and Superagent and build tools like Browserify and Esprima.

  body: >
    To most people in JS, functional programmers are perceived as academic hipsters raving about things like applicative functors, semigroup homomorphisms and Yoneda lemmas for no good reason except to make the rest of us feel stupid. And this is fair; there's no better way to make you feel pitifully mainstream than throwing category theory at you. Conversely, JS programmers tend to believe functional programming, therefore, can have no real world application because nobody in the real world has any idea what a Yoneda lemma is and they seem to be getting by just fine without it.


    Except we aren't. We've been living in callback hell for almost two decades now, and no matter how many control flow libraries we submit to npm, things don't seem to be getting any better. And that's where functional programming comes in—turns out callbacks are just functions, and those academics in their ivory towers with their Haskell compilers actually encountered and solved these problems long ago. And now we can have their solutions in JS too, because of functional reactive programming. To demonstrate, I'll attempt to write a browser based game, from scratch, with ponies, using RxJS, everybody's favourite reactive library, live on stage in 30 minutes with no callback hell in sight. And we'll be finding out if this reactive stuff is all it's cracked up to be or not.

    our culture as a company and a community. Traditionally copywriters on a software team are viewed as a
    supporting role: we help sell what gets made. But what if all contributors to a team were true equals
    capable of leading and shaping a continuously improving company culture? That's the foundation of emotional safety.

  title: Battle Hardened Node.js for the Enterprise
  body: >
    What does enterprise grade server-side Javascript look like?   Do you work at a large org over 2000 people that probably is a Java or .Net shop?  Could you be better served leveraging the cloud and the vibrant Node.js community for some projects?  Do you need to convince your boss?


    At Fidelity we have several security/quality checkpoints across many departments to validate that applications and platforms protect customer data.  Security code reviews, penetration test, risk audits, legal compliance and many other factors go into signing off on  an application.  Fidsafe is a new virtual safe deposit box offering by Fidelity that is the first application to be served outside the Fidelity firewall on the cloud.  Fidsafe challenges every aspect of how the organization builds and deploys software.  We had to answer a lot of questions and provide practical tooling/solutions to get Node into production.


    We will cover what it takes from top to bottom build and operate a secure and scalable service backend implemented in Node.js and deployed to AWS.  Topics covered:


    * Node Process Management
      * Lifecycle management – Upstart and Forever
      * Smart defaults for scalability and uptime
      * Reactor — How we use cluster to scale across cores
    * Hardened Express
      * End to End Javascript — CouchDB / MongoDB
      * Layering security using middleware
      * Strategies for bulletproof cookies
      * SSL termination strategies
      * Authenticating end-users and API consumers
    * Building a Secure PaaS — A brief overview
      * If you want it to be secure you have to build your own. What's the minimum you need for Node?
      * Devops in across organizational boundaries — AWS, Python, Boto, AMIs, and Asgard
      * Ubuntu as PaaS — real solutions are diverse and polyglot

  title: Writing Custom DSLs
  body: >
    When writing complex business logic, it is critically important to maintain clean code though the judicious applications of Test Driven Development and Domain Driven Design.  However, even these powerful techniques fall short of solving the problem at the heart of building complex software: building what the customer actually wants.


    Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) allow us to capture complex business requirements in code written in the language of the customer.  Once an ubiquitous language between you and your customer is defined and implemented as a DSL, the code can quite literally be given back to the customer to edit and refine.   This is not a theory, or a myth.  I have done this under real-world constraints and deadlines, and you can as well.


    JavaScript's ability to blend Object Oriented and Functional Programming paradigms makes it an ideal language for authoring custom DSLs.  Unfortunately, too often developers are unclear on how to identify when a custom DSL is an appropriate solution, and when it is, how to go about writing one.  I will take you through the process of developing a few different custom DSLs from planning to implementation, as well as how to performance tune and debug your new custom language.   My hope is that you will gain a powerful tool for managing complex software that will keep you sane, and your customers happy.

  title: "Improving 2D & 3D Canvas Performance on the Web, One Frame at a Time"
  body: >
    New to working with <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>? Never fear, we'll give you a light introduction to some of the high-level concepts about working in 3D space and go through some minimal examples before we do a deep dive into grittier details. We'll look at in-browser tools as well as plugins found in multiple browser ecosystems: not just one, because the web is everywhere and your game should be too.

    We'll talk about how to debug and improve the performance of both 2D and 3D canvas contexts, including WebGL code. Though we will be talking largely about games, we'll also look at chart libraries as well and discuss using canvas as compared to SVG. Even if you're only working with a 3rd party library, you need to know how to profile performance and spot jank, as well as what action to take when you find it. You'll learn how to mitigate the overhead of doing a lot of 3D math, as well as how to get good performance on low-end devices.
