<h1>Getting to and from JSConf US 2014</h1>
<p>The Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort is on Amelia Island in northeast Florida, just across the St. Marys River from Georgia and adjacent to the historic city of Fernandina. The resort overlooks the azure blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean on the east and the Intracoastal Waterway on the west. Though private, secluded and protected by a gated entry, it is relatively easy to get to.</p>
<p>It is just a short 45 minute drive from downtown Jacksonville, and 29 miles from Jacksonville International Airport. To make your journey to JSConf a little nicer, Meteor is sponsoring airport shuttles to and from Jacksonville International Airport (JAX) and the Omni Amelia Island for you. Please review the schedule below and ensure you understand how this will work before arriving at JAX as you might need to wait for a bus OR find other means of transportation based on your time of arrivals/departures. We have tried to use the information you provided us during activity registration to cover as many people as possible.</p>
<h3>The Meteor Airport Shuttles</h3>
<p>On May 27<sup>th</sup>, 2014, we will have shuttles leaving Jacksonville Airport (JAX) every 45 minutes headed to the Amelia Island resort. These shuttles will be loading passengers at the <strong>Pre-Arranged Commercial Transportation</strong> area, on the North side of the airport. If you are just entering the baggage claim area, this will be to your left and at the end of baggage claim. Please use the map below as a fairly good guide for your to find the bus station. The bus will have the <a href="https://github.com/voodootikigod/logo.js">community JS logo</a> clearly displayed on the bus, so be sure to look for that! If you find a bus with the <a href="https://twitter.com/horse_js">@horse_js</a> logo, we have no idea where that bus will go and leave it up to the reader to decide their own course of action.</p>

<p>The bus will <strong>depart</strong> from the loading zone every 45 minutes, barring traffic and other delays. We will have staff at the airport to assist for part of the day, but not necessarily the whole day. If you get lost, in the middle of the baggage claim section there is an information desk that will gladly point you in the way of the <strong>Pre-arranged Commercial Transportation</strong>. The schedule for <strong>BUS DEPARTURES FROM JACKSONVILLE AIRPORT</strong> on May 27<sup>th</sup> (all in local time - EST) is:</p>

<p>After the conference is over, we are happy to provide similar transportation back to Jacksonville International Airport (JAX). The loading zone for the that bus will be located just outside of the main hotel lobby. It will <strong>depart</strong> from the hotel every hour, on the hour and will take roughly 45 minutes to get to the airport and unload from the bus. <strong>Plan accordingly based on your specific departure time</strong>.
