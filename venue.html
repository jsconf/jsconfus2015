      <p class="lead">Nestled in Florida, just south of Georgia, the barrier island of Amelia Island is an absolute paradise, in part because it is remote location. The closest airport is <a href="http://www.jia.aero/">Jacksonville International Airport (JAX)</a>, roughly 29 miles from the resort. If you opt to rent a car OR drive to Amelia Island, there is plenty of free parking on the resort If you do bring a car, you can head to the historic and beautiful <a href="http://www.ameliaisland.com/">Fernandina Beach</a>. <br/><br/>
